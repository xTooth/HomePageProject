				<h2>Welcome!</h2>
				<p>This website is a little bit of a demonstration of the things I can do. Nothing special, a bit of odds and ends from here and there,
				put together into some sort of structure. Hopefully I've done my job well enough so that you, the reader, will enjoy your stay.<br><br>
				Everything on this site is built from scratch, I've used this as a tool and platform for learning new things and maintaining skills I
				don't really use in my schoolwork. This has also worked as a way for me to get used to Mac as I recently purchased a MacBook Pro for my
				"on the go" needs.<br><br>
				I will however do a bit of a disclaimer here. I'm not a professional, yet. So beware of odd behaviour, inconsistensies and other wierdness!
				This includes at least the fact that nano refuses to believe that these files are UTF-8 encoded, and breaks if I try to use the 
				normal/correct markup for letters like &auml; and &eacute;, fun times.<br><br>
