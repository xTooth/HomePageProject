			<h2>Hello!</h2>
			<br>
			<p>
				So I'll start off by saying this:As you may be able to tell this is very much a work in progress. Im working on
				this
				site in my sprare time which isnt a whole
				lot due to my studies, work and my attempt at having a social life! So here is a list of possibly useful or totally
				useless facts about me<br /> <br />
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						I am a third"ish" year student at the University of Helsinki Deparment of Computer Science. What I mean by this
						is that I'm looking to get my Bachelor's either next fall or the spring 2020.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						I strongly believe in a good sense of humour both in and outside of the workplace.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						I consider myself to be trilingual, English being my weakest language. My first language is Swedish, but my
						Finnish is just as fluent.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						I love music and I play drums. I mostly listen to heavier stuff but enjoy a whole spectrum of genres.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Love learning new things and I'm not afraid to fail. Failures are after all one of the best lessons.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						I currently live in Vantaa (insert joke about not being able to afford living in Helsinki)
					</p>
				</li>
