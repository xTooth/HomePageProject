					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>This is just a short list of the different languages and things I am familiar and proficient with.
					I also hope to give some context as to where I have aquired said skills and a rough picture of what I 
					can do with them. So without further ado:
					</p>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div>
					<h2>Programming Languages</h2>
					<br>
					<h3>Java</h3>
					<p>Java is the language I'm most familiar with due to the fact that it is the primary language we use in school.
					I've worked on several different thing using Java, everything from backend program logic to basic AI. You can
					find a few examples of java methods I've written in the "programming examples" tab.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>HTML5</h3>
					<p>So I suppose this is one of the more obvious ones given where this is written. I'm not going to claim that I'm a
					webdeveloper or that I "know" HTML5, but I can create some basic websites from scratch. I know most of the elements
					and understand how they work, and this project in particular has thought me how to troubleshoot issues as I'm not following
					any particular set of instructions. All I can hope is that any shortcomings aren't noticable to the end user.
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>CSS3</h3>
					<p>Surpisingly enough the same statement rings true here. Odd isn't it. Since cascading style sheets really goes
					hand in hand with HTML I haven't used it separetly. I can pull of basic styling features, BUT when it comes to more
					complex things I usually resort to the: How to ("inset what I'm trying to accomplish")? on allmighty Google. This has
					worked out just fine so far, and I ususally just need a pointer in the right direction to get started.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>JavaScript</h3>
					<p>Javascript and all of the frameworks built using it are still somewhat unfamiliar to me. Working on them constantly and
					there for I hope I may edit this text soon. That being said I have used js for various things and its not a complete unknown.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Node</h3>
					<p>This one is kind of a work in progress for me, this project might see some changes in that regard soon :D</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>SQL</h3>
					<p>In short the basics. I have used MySQL, SQLServer and SQlite. They are not new to me but I am by no means an expert. I like to
					think of it as room to grow. SQL has become familiar to me trough schoolwork.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>C#, XML and WPF</h3>
					<p>I consider C# to be a dialect of Java or vice versa. Similar syntax and functions. It has been a while since I did windows
					specific developement, which is the only thing I have used theese for, allthough I am aware that especially XML is useful 
					elsewere too! I learned theese trough a little sideproject and trough a friend who works with windows specific developement.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>C</h3>
					<p>Really just the raw basics. I have attended a course in C programming.
					</p>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div>
					<h2>Operating Systems</h2>
					<br>
					<h3>Linux</h3>
					<p>I am fairly familiar with the Ubuntu flavour of Linux. Allthough my use of this operating system is currently rather
					limited. I am only running it on a virtual machine on my PC for the pourpuse of coding C (which turned out to be a nightmare
					on Windows). However I have used it a fair bit and know my way around for basic tasks, aswell as using the Terminal.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Mac</h3>
					<p>Full disclosure, I just purchased a MacBook Pro, so I'm new to Os X, as this is my fyrst Apple computer, but so far I've
					no regrets for going the Apple way for portable computing. Especially after installing homebrew. But in all fairness I can't
					say I know the system yet.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Windows</h3>
					<p> This is by far the OS I've used the most, and therefore also know it fairly well. I have used as a developement platform
					but currently I use it mostly for recreational pourpuses: games. Since the other two platforms are superior for developement,
					(obvioisly just my uneducated opinion)and I have access to all three "mainstream" OS:s,  Windows has basicly become a host for
					Steam and my linux VM.
					</p>
				</div>
				<br>
				<div>
					<h2>Other</h2>
					<br>
					<h3>General Design</h3>
					<p>I am familiar with UML and I take the planning and designing of projects very seriously. I'm a firm believer in that you save
					a lot of time and effort by planning your projects in advance and doing so properly. When doing this I always try to take into 
					consideration modularity, designing classes and methods to be as universally useful as possible.
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>IDE:s</h3>
					<p>This is very much a mixed bag. I have tried Eclipse, AndroidStudio, Visual Studio code, Intellj IDEA, Netbeans  and done some
					small projects in Visual Studio. Currently I am mainly using NetBeans due to the TMC plugin which isn't availiable for other IDE:s.
					(unless you use the commandline version) I also do a lot of stuff "grass roots style" using GNU nano.
